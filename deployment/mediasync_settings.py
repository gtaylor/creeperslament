This module determines how to combine various JS/CSS files into monolithic,
minified, compressed chunks. This cuts down page load time drastically,
and saves us a lot of bandwidth.

There are also a number of mediasync-related settings in the MEDIASYNC dict
at the bottom of this module. This dict is imported by the various 
settings/staging_settings/prod_settings modules.
